# ATC Tutorial for FlightGear the FOSS Flight Sim

Visit: http://atc-tutorial.appspot.com/


- Idea is to create an interactive site to teach the basics of ATC.
- The goal is to have some 3d widgets and maps etc to visualise some of the material

Site is built using:
- python27 on Google App Engine
- flask framework with jinja2 templating
- bootstrap for layouts and structure

Goals:
- try and make a nice clean consise guide for muppets
- avoid png and images in favour to javascript live
- embed videos and rich media
- make interactive
